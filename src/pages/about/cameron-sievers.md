ethos: > 
  From the perspective of a VCE English teacher, with fifteen years in the job and a career in theatre directing, playwriting and film-making, the challenge is to ensure that students are inspired to actively perceive the integration of areas of study, as a means of making sense of the subject and its application to the world, both past and present (film study embodies an obvious crossover to the analysis of visual content in argument analysis). In addition, high achievement and human empowerment often require the opportunity to reach beyond conventional wisdom, as a means of generating unique and personal, but no less credible responses. It is the ability to think, to have empathy, and to walk into a potentially hostile room to present a point of view that are arguably the most important life skills VCE English imparts. As a passionate advocate for and active participant in the construction and presentation of the English language, it is clear to me that the fight for the preservation of language is at a delicate evolutionary stage. Those who can communicate the life skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing will be empowered to inspire future generations.
