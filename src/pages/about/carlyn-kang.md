ethos: >
  As parents, teachers and students, how often do we ask ourselves these
  questions

  Why am I doing what I am doing?  How often do we find joy in what we do?  What
  am I really learning? 

  Education in the 21st century has, sadly, shifted the attention of many of our
  students, parents and teachers to a regimented result-driven learning and
  teaching process. At school, students are given every opportunity to acquire
  knowledge and skills, yet many struggle to form an authentic understanding of
  the content taught. The problem lies in the way we perceive knowledge and
  skills as educators. We fail to recognise the value of knowledge as a process
  rather than an answer. As a result, we become accustomed to a result-focused
  pedagogy that yields little or no lifelong success, joy or fulfilment. 

  From a passionate educator’s perspective, I believe that success comes from a
  patience-driven process that focuses on the authentic and purposeful
  engagement with the content. It is through communicating and nurturing one’s
  mental agility; one develops passion for, and an insight into the subject
  learnt. The value of learning becomes pivotal to personal growth beyond the
  academic sphere. My dedication to developing a process-driven pedagogy has led
  me to found Edcellent Education as an educational hub. Edcellent is inspired
  to empower individuals to pursue self-awareness and lifelong learning, through
  cultivating creative and critical thinking skills as a primary life-skill.
