ethos: >-
  Language is obviously amongst the most profound and necessary of the forces
  that shape our lives and thought. Language, as has so often been said, is
  power. A critical examination of the ways in which it is constructed and used
  is essential, both as a defence against the blandishments of bogus ideas and
  as a source of intellectual pleasure in itself. This pleasure can be a
  stimulus to intellectual curiosity and achievement, and perhaps even to a more
  empathetic identification with its manifold users.  With thirty years as a
  teacher and researcher, Dr Hoy is a communicator who has a passion for and a
  pleasure in language.  His aim is to inspire his students to share that
  passion and pleasure - firstly, so that they can improve their grades but,
  more importantly, for the enrichment of their lives and thinking.
