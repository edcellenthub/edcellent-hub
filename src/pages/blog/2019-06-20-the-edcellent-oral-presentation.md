# **Who am I?**

**As a writer and director of eighteen theatre productions, in Melbourne and London, I have a lot of experience working with actors on some of the finest speeches ever written.** 

**As a London trained, MA qualified theatre and film maker, I know how great rhetoric operates on the audience.**

**It gives me great pleasure to announce that as Edcellent’s VCE English Coordinator and foremost content creator, I will be running an oral presentation masterclass in the upcoming school holidays.**

****

# **Who are you?**

**You are a standard English VCE student (Year 11 or 12).** 

**You will have a rough idea of your topic to be delivered in term 3. (If you haven’t yet decided on your topic: don’t worry! I will help you find one).**

**Year 11 participants will gain a decisive advantage in this area of study**



# **What is it?**

**This is a comprehensive, two-part, 3 hour masterclass that achieves the following:**

**Part one (am session: Monday July 1, 10.30-12.00): the theory, psychology and practice of persuasion in media texts and speeches.**

**Part two (am session: Wednesday July 3, 10.30-12.00): student engagement with and drafting of their oral presentation topics of choice.**

# **What do you learn?**

**You will learn how to craft a fine piece of persuasion on a relevant topic to a chosen audience.**

**You will embrace a range of new tactics in the art of rhetoric, including many creative concepts.**

**You will develop an understanding of the psychology of persuasion and how to effectively deploy ethos, pathos and logos.**

**You will acknowledge that the only way for persuasion to take place is to understand the needs of your audience.**

**You will be challenged to consider the ‘Hostile Room’ scenario - that is, topics that embrace unpopular or uncomfortable truths. In doing so, you will have a greater chance of standing out in assessment!**

**You will sharpen your presentation skills.**
