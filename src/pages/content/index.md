  - type: "Speech Writing Master Class"
    problem: Many students do little more than present facts, information and opinion in the absence of human connection. The oversight here is the assumption that having a valid opinion, on its own, makes one persuasive. Opinion is the beginning of persuasion, and if it is not accompanied by a range of psychological factors that endear an audience to the speaker or writer, the opinion will often fail to persuade.
    solution: At Edcellent, we educate our students the value of scarcity. To present an opinion on the same issue as several other classmates risks the prospect of devaluation. The ability to effectively present controversial and under-explored views increases our students’ chances of obtaining strong marks. Our speech writing master class will show you how to present controversial and under-explored views successfully!
  - type: "Argument Analysis"
    problem: The AA area of study requires a 'total literacy' approach in order to be communicated in a holistic fashion. This is often unrealisable and, in some cases, unrealistic because of a dearth in general knowledge and a lack of curiosity in world events. AA involves a conceptual skill-set jump between year ten and VCE. In many instances, students are not being prepared to make this jump.
    solution: At Edcellent, we create our own pedagogy that focuses on how to compose mature AA responses by deriving arguments through the visual material itself. Understanding that 70% of all brain functioning is devoted to visual analysis, our AA classes alert students to the problem of passive analysis with constructive, on the spot (in class) writing and editing solutions.
